## Overview

ResNet50 is used as a benchmark for image classification tasks on the ZCU102 board.

## Running Inference

Use the following command to run ResNet50 inference:

```bash
./resnet50_host \
  --weight_path resnet-models/resnet50_weights.bin \
  --image_path images/frog.bin \
  --labels_path resnet-models/imagenet_classes.txt \
  --xclbin binary_container_1.xclbin
```

### Parameters
- `--weight_path`: Path to the pre-quantized weights.
- `--image_path`: Path to the binary image file.
- `--labels_path`: Path to the ImageNet class labels.
- `--xclbin`: The FPGA binary container.
```
