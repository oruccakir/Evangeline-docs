# Evangeline

Evangeline is a framework for running AI models on **Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA**. The project provides complete end-to-end tooling for deploying AI models from development to production on the **ZCU102 Evaluation Kit**.

## Supported Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="ResNet50 CNN" icon="image" href="/resnet50/overview">
    50-layer deep convolutional neural network for ImageNet image classification with 1000 classes. Optimized FPGA kernels for convolution, pooling, and batch normalization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stories15M LLM" icon="message" href="/stories15m/overview">
    15-million parameter Transformer-based language model for text generation. Implements attention mechanisms, RoPE embeddings, and KV-cache for inference.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Features

- **Dual-Path Compilation**: Seamlessly switch between CPU-only development and FPGA acceleration
- **HLS Kernel Library**: Pre-optimized High-Level Synthesis kernels for common neural network operations
- **YAML-Based Configuration**: Flexible build system with declarative configuration files
- **Complete Deployment Pipeline**: From source code to SD card-bootable images
- **Benchmark Suite**: Built-in accuracy and performance measurement tools
